Checkers AI focuses on optimizing already existing algorithms, minimax, and alpha pruning, and also coming up with different heuristics to improve our performance. In addition use Reinforment Learning to improve certain cases such as end-game(when only a few pieces are left). This has benefits that it could be tailored to apply in many similar Reinforced AI applications directly or indirectly.
