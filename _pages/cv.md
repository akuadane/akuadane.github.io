## Experience

**Research Assistant** | Fordham University | New York, US | Aug 2024 – Present
- Optimized Large Language Models (LLMs) on a limited dataset to predict Multiple Sclerosis relapses, leveraging pre-training to overcome data scarcity and improve early diagnosis accuracy
- Improved predictive performance by finetuning LLMs to achieve a good balance of 80% positive relapse detection rate and 0.69 ROC AUC score
- Developed an API using Django to enable seamless testing of third-party ML models on a proprietary patient dataset
- Paper accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025
- Supervisor: Dr. [Yijun Zhao](https://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~yzhao/)

**Software Engineering Intern** | Fordham University | New York, US | May 2025 – Aug 2025
- Led the development of a capital budget tracking software using TypeScript (Angular & Express), reducing financial management errors by streamlining budgeting workflows and improving process efficiency
- Implemented an audit feature using PostgreSQL triggers, strengthening security and enabling full audit trails, resulting in a measurable 80% reduction in reported inconsistencies
- Created a dashboard with 95% coverage of key administrative metrics, significantly increasing operational visibility
- Wrote bash scripts to automate deployment to the development server, & backup database dump on AWS S3

**Software Engineer** | Turing | Remote | Sep 2022 – Aug 2024
- Contracted via Turing to support OpenAI's dataset engineering for ChatGPT, by solving complex software engineering problems with Python to prepare high-quality datasets aligning ChatGPT for executing Python code in its sandbox
- Resolved 100+ backend integration issues with remote APIs and developed PyTests with step-by-step workflows, enhancing LLM training efficiency in reasoning and coding tasks
- Designed a strategy to reuse discarded datasets for failure mode simulation, expanding training coverage, and improving model resilience against edge cases
- Partnered with ML researchers to review model performance and implement adjustments
