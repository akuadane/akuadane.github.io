Hi, 
I am a master’s student pursuing data science at Fordham University. Prior to this, I worked at Turing as a consultant software engineer for OpenAI. As an aspiring data scientist with a background in software engineering, I’m interested in utilizing machine learning and data analysis tools to provide solutions 🪛.


Outside of class, I like to cook 🍛, drink coffee ☕️, hike ⛰ and hang out with friends.
